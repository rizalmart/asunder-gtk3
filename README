* Allows for each track to be by a different artist
* Does not require a specific desktop environment

To compile from source you may need the -dev or -devel versions of GTK and libcddb. On Ubuntu these packages are called libgtk2.0-dev and libcddb2-dev.

Compiling
=========
First install all the dependencies. LAME, Vorbis-Tools, FLAC, FDK-AAC and Wavpack don't have to be installed to compile. They are only needed at runtime if you choose to encode in those formats.

mpcenc and mac are also not required and may be difficult to install on your distribution. If you really want them, you probably already have them.

Then run:

./configure # If you don't see a 'configure' file, run './autogen.sh' first. 

If you get errors, it's probably a missing dependency so you'll have to install that first. Afterwards, run:

make

There shouldn't be any errors.

Now you can run asunder from the 'src' directory, but you probably want to install it, so:

su
[enter root password]
make install

And on something like Ubuntu that won't let you su:

sudo make install
[enter user's password]

If on any of the steps above you get errors, or even warnings, please do send me the output so I can fix them.

Contact
=======
I would love to hear from you, to know how you made use of Asunder, or with bug reports, or feature requests. Please use the form at http://littlesvr.ca/contact.php to send me email. Thanks in advance!

Bug Reports
===========
Please help me improve Asunder by sending me bug reports. The more of the following you can do, the easier it will be for me to fix:
- be able to reproduce the bug consistently
- select "Log to /tmp/asunder.log" in the advanced preferences and send me the asunder.log file
- if it only happens with one CD, tell me what it is and, if it's freely available, where I can get it
- it's better to give me too much detail than too little
